## 📸 Technical Highlights

### **Modern Layout Engine**
The project leverages **CSS Grid** for complex sections like the "Popular" and "Discover" grids. By using `grid-template-columns` and `repeat()` functions within media queries, the interface automatically reorganizes itself based on the viewport width (540px, 768px, and 1024px).

### **Dynamic Animation Sequencing**
Instead of static elements, the site uses a JavaScript-based `scrollRevealOption` object to maintain a consistent animation duration and distance. Elements are revealed with specific delays (ranging from 500ms to 2000ms) to guide the user's eye through the brand story.
